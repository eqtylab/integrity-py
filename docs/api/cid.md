# CID

A CID is a content identifier: a stable identifier derived from the content of a file, directory, or serialized object.

In `eqty_sdk`, CIDs are one of the core building blocks of provenance. Assets, computation inputs and outputs, and many low-level statements are connected through CIDs. If the content changes, the CID changes too, which is what makes it useful for integrity and reproducibility.

Most users do not create `CID` objects directly very often. Instead, they usually get them from asset constructors such as `Dataset.from_path(...)`, or from existing manifests and statements.
