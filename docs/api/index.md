# API Reference

`eqty_sdk` is the Python SDK for building verifiable manifests around data, models, prompts, agents, computations, and related lineage. It combines low-level cryptographic identifiers and signed statements with higher-level helpers for common provenance workflows.

The main features exposed by the SDK are:

- asset types for files, directories, datasets, models, prompts, tools, agents, and other domain objects
- `@compute` for capturing execution lineage and emitted outputs
- contexts for grouping graphs and targeting Governance Studio projects
- signers and verification-oriented metadata for attestations and model signing
- services for blob registration and Governance Studio integration
- lower-level statement APIs for advanced or custom graph construction

Most users should start with `init()`, assets, contexts, and `@compute`, then drop into lower-level APIs only when the higher-level abstractions do not fit the workflow they need.

The reference pages below are generated with `mkdocstrings` from the Python package and generated stubs, with additional narrative where the SDK benefits from usage guidance.
