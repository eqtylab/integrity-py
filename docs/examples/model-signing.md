# Model Signing

Model signing is explicit. A model-signing statement is only attempted when:

- the asset was created with `Model.from_path(...)`
- the provided path is a directory
- the active signer uses a `SECP256R1` key
- `_enable_model_signing_signature=True`

Source: `examples/model-signing.py`

```python
--8<-- "examples/model-signing.py"
```

Notes:

- Only `SECP256R1` keys are supported for model-signing statements and sigstore bundle generation.
- You must call `Model.from_path(...)` with a directory path and set `_enable_model_signing_signature=True` to get sigstore bundles.
- If the active signer is not compatible with model signing, the SDK logs a warning instead of failing asset creation.
