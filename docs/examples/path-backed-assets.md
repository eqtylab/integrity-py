# Path-Backed Assets

Many real SDK integrations register files and directories from disk rather than in-memory Python objects. This example shows the common `from_path(...)` flow for several asset types.

Source: `examples/path-backed-assets.py`

```python
--8<-- "examples/path-backed-assets.py"
```

Notes:

- `from_path(...)` hashes the resolved file or directory contents and uses that CID in the graph.
- `Code`, `Document`, `Database`, and `Dataset` all support the same basic path-backed pattern.
