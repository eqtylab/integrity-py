# Auth Service Signer

This example creates or reuses a signer backed by an auth service instead of generating a purely local signer.

Source: `examples/auth-service-signer.py`

```python
--8<-- "examples/auth-service-signer.py"
```

Notes:

- `EQTY_API_KEY` must be set before calling `Signer.auth_service(...)`.
- `_load_if_exists=True` is useful for repeated runs because it reuses the persisted signer configuration instead of creating a new one every time.
