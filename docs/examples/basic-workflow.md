# Basic Workflow

This example shows the common path:

1. Initialize the SDK.
2. Create and activate a signer.
   - If a signer was created previously, that signer can be re-used on subsequent executions.
3. Create input assets.
4. Define a computation with the `@compute` decorator.
5. Execute the computation with a few arguments.
6. Export a manifest json file.
